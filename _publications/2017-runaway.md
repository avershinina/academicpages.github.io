Karyotype is a number and organization of chromosomes. Human karyotype is n=23 (=haploid) X-shaped chromosomes. Blue butterfly karyotype ranges from n=10 to n=134. Imagine having so many chromosomes!

We discovered a correlation between karyotype changes and phylogeny branch lengths (i.e. length of evolutionary branch). This gradual pattern is inconsistent with the hybrid-sterility model which, due to association of major chromosome changes with cladogenetic events (like, for ex. speciation), predicts a high degree of punctualism in karyotype evolution.
