If you are a Windows user, download and install [putty](https://www.putty.org/). Ask someone to get you on the server. 

If you are using Linux, you know what to do.

# Final assignment

When you are done with all assignments, come to me and ask for the final assignment.
Only after completing the final assignment you are allowed to be on the lab server.
For the final assignment you will be given a real working shell script. Your goal is to figure out what this script is doing. In order to pass, you will need to comment EACH LINE of the script explaining what it does. 

# Ask questions!
